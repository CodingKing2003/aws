To install Docker on Ubuntu, you can use the following commands. These commands will install Docker from the official Docker repository:

Update your package database:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
Install the required packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Add Docker's official GPG key:
bash
Copy code
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
Add the Docker repository to your APT sources:
For Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa):

bash
Copy code
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
For Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish):

bash
Copy code
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu jammy stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
Update the package database again to include the Docker repository:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
Finally, install Docker:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Start and enable the Docker service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
To verify that Docker is installed and running, you can run the following command:
bash
Copy code
sudo docker --version
You should see the version of Docker that was installed on your system.

Please note that you need root or sudo privileges to execute these commands.
